        "\n",
        "**Reasons for Improved Accuracy**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Enhanced Contextual Focus: The addition of an attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically focus on more relevant words within each input sentence, improving its ability to identify key sentiment-indicating terms like \"love,\" \"terrible,\" and \"fantastic.\" This selective focus helps the model better understand which words or phrases carry sentiment weight in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Refined Representation of Sentiments: By introducing an attention layer, the model now generates a more refined and representative embedding for each input sentence, as it aggregates information across all words while highlighting the most influential ones. This refined representation improves the classifier’s performance in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Reduction in Noise: Without the attention mechanism, the model processes all words in an equal manner, which might dilute the importance of sentiment-laden words in sentences with irrelevant or neutral words. Attention helps mitigate this issue by allowing the model to \"ignore\" parts of the text that are less relevant, thereby reducing noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "The improved accuracy after adding the attention layer highlights its effectiveness in enhancing the model's understanding of textual sentiment. Attention layers are particularly beneficial for sentiment analysis tasks, where key words carry significant weight. This experiment demonstrates that integrating attention not only improves prediction accuracy but also suggests that attention mechanisms are valuable for models tasked with nuanced text analysis, especially in identifying sentiment patterns more reliably.\n",
